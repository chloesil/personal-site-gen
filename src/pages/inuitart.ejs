            York University's Center for Mobilizing Inuit Cultural Heritage approached me to design an interactive map for "Design Latitudes," an exposition at the University of Alberta.
          </p>
          <p>The map shows major hotspots for Inuit culture and art across Canada, and how they relate and connect to each other. Each image is linked to a digital piece which can be viewed by pointing a smartphone at it.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">The goal of the piece was to raise awareness of the importance of Inuit art and culture i our lives, and how it can influence how we look at other areas of life such as nature and sustainability.</span></p>
